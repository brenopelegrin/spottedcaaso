A social network destinated to the USP Campus SÃ£o Carlos students

## Test

To test the project, go to the [deployment site on Vercel](https://spottedcaaso.vercel.app).

As we use Render to deploy the api, it should take a time for the Render instance to boot up. 

Before accessing the frontend on Vercel, please open the [backend health check](https://spottedcaaso-api.onrender.com/health) to spin up the instance.

## frontend

Made with React + Typescript + ChakraUI.

## backend

Made with AdonnisJS
